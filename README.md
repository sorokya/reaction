## üöÄ How to Run

Reaction API can be configured using the following environment variables:

| **Variable**    | **Description**               | **Default Value** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| `REACTION_DB`   | Path to the SQLite database   | `./reactions.db`  |
| `REACTION_HOST` | Host the API should listen on | `0.0.0.0`         |
| `REACTION_PORT` | Port the API should listen on | `8080`            |

The API will automatically create a SQLite database if one doesn't exist.

### Run the API

- Using Cargo (if built locally):
```sh
cargo run --release
```

- Using Prebuilt Binary:
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/sorokya/reaction/releases/latest) for your system and run:
```sh
./reaction
```
